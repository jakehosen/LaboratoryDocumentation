When the order arrives, let Jake know when the order has shown up, or if you submitted the purchase request, then respond to the corresponding BusinessCenter@purdue.edu email. Make sure to check the packing slip to ensure that all items have been received and there are no items on back order, it's also possible parts have yet to arrive that aren't documented on the packing slip.

### Local Purchasing
There are three (3) cards that you can check out from the Business Office for lab supplies. This is the preferred method of purchasing misc. supplies locally.  Please remember to have your approval and funding prior to coming into the office to make the purchase. This can be an email to me that copies fnrbusinessoffice@purdue.edu or it can be a signature on the attached PCard purchasing form (which is brought into the office when checking out the card).  Cards are checked out and returned in the same day (before 2:00 PM).

### Reimbursement
Fill out purchasing form with yourself as the vendor. Your address needs to match what's in Successfactor's employement record on file. List all items and quantities with item #s and prices as normal. Email along with copy/photo of receipt/invoice to Jake to approve the reimbursement, then forward to Jennifer Spitznagle jlspitzn@purdue.edu.


Note: sales tax will not be reimbursed. There are tax exemption cards and forms availavble for local vendors. Ask Jake or Jennifer Spitznagle.
