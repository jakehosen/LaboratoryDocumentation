# Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph

## Start-Up
1. Open the 4 gas cylinders attached to the instrument by opening the valves on top of each cylinder. Do not change anything on the regulator, use the valve on top of the cylinder to open and close.
    * Check that there is adequate gas in each cylinder (ideally at least 500 psi each).
2. Turn on the power on the autosampler (switch is on the controller labeled *game boy*).
