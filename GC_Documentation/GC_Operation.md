# Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph

## Start-Up
1. Open the 4 gas cylinders attached to the instrument by opening the valves on top of each cylinder. Do not change anything on the regulator, use the valve on top of the cylinder to open and close.
    * Check that there is adequate gas in each cylinder (ideally at least 500 psi each).
2. Turn on the power on the autosampler (switch is on the controller labeled *game boy*).
3. If the GC is not already on, turn it on using the switch on the right side of the instrument.
4. Open the GHG Control software using (using the icon below, located on the computer desktop).
5. Click "Connect" on the resulting screen. This will open the Lab Solutions software login screen. You don't need to enter anything, just click "okay".
6. On the left column, select the open "system on" and then select "okay". The software start-up is the preferred way to start the machine.
    * Check the instrument for errors. Most commonly, there will be an error that the flame ionization detector (FID) has failed to ignite. If that is the case, press the button labeled "DET" on the front of the instrument. If the screen reads "Flame  = Off" then you should select "PF1: Ignite" using the relevant soft key. This may take a minute or two to complete. You can switch batch to the monitoring screen
